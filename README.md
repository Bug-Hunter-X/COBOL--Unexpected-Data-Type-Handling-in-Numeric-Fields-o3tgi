This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, bug in COBOL programs. The issue arises from the mishandling of data types. COBOL's rigid type system necessitates careful consideration when transferring data between fields of different types. This example highlights how assigning non-numeric values to a field expecting a numeric value can lead to unexpected program behavior, including crashes or incorrect outputs.
